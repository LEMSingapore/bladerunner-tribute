## Expected Functionality (MVP)
- The Bladerunner movie (1982) is one of the most influential movies in the sci-fi/cyber-punk genre. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner)  
- User can read comments/quotes on the Bladerunner wall (inspired by the Lennon Wall- See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon_Wall)
- User can add/edit/delete comments/quotes on the Bladerunner movie.
- User can watch tribute YouTube videos
- User can read the Bladerunner movie backstory and read the full script

### Index Page ("The Wall")

1. The app should have a wall page (graffi-like inspired by the Lennon Wall) where
	- all the quotes are displayed
	- the images link to the quote's show page
	- and there should be a link to add a new quote/comment.

### Show Page 

1. Your show page should display a product with
	- a link back to the Wall Page
	- a link to edit the quote (goes to the edit page)
	- a delete button that deletes the quote


### Edit & New Page

1. These views should render forms and submit to the appropriate routes.

### Redirects 

1. The create route should redirect to the index.

2. The delete route should redirect to the index.

3. The update route will redirect back to the quote's show page.

### Static Pages

1. Tribute Video Page where user can scroll through a YouTube playlist and watch tribute videos.

2. Bladerunner Script Page where user can read through the movie script.

3. Bladerunner Backstory Page where user can read the movie's backstory.
